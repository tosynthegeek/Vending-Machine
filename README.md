# Vending Machine

The Credit for this code goes to Block Explorer

In this contract, I built a simple vending machine with just a few features. This was a very simple contract, but it was nice to refresh my knowledge of mappings and contract logic.

## Features

-  You can view the current balance in the vending machine
- Restocking the vending machine
- Limiting the restocking feature to only the contract owner
- Revert transaction when there is not enough stock and when less than 2 ether is paid for an item in the vending machine


## Getting Started

To build this application in development, I used the following dependencies:

OpenZeppelin: Library for building reliable contracts on Ethereum

Remix IDE

Metamask: Identity to interact with the Blockchain

Etherscan: Block explorer for verifying/exploring transactions and contracts on Ethereum
