#** Vending-Machine**

The Credit for this code goes to Block Explorer

In this contract, I built a simple vending machine with just a few features

#**Features**

• You can view the current balance in the vending machine

• Restocking the vending machine

• Limiting the restocking feature to only the contract owner

• Revert transaction when there is not enough stock and when less than 2 ether is paid for an item in the vending machine

This was a very simple contract, but it was nice to refresh my knowledge of mappings and contract logic.
